href="#Conformal-Field-Theory" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Conformal field theory (CFT) is one of the central topics of modern physics. It refers to a field theory that is invariant under conformal transformations that preserve the angles between vectors. In spacetime dimension <span>$d&gt;2$</span>, the global conformal symmetry transformations form a group <span>$\mathrm{SO}(d+1,1)$</span>, generated by translation, <span>$\mathrm{SO}(d)$</span> rotation (Here we work in Euclidean signature. In Lorentzian signature it is the Lorentz transformation <span>$\mathrm{SO}(1,d-1)$</span>), dilatation (scale transformation), and special conformal transformation (SCT) Each CFT operator must transform under irreducible representations of rotation and dilatation. The representations are labelled by the <span>$\mathrm{SO}(d)$</span> spin <span>$l$</span> and scaling dimension <span>$\Delta$</span>, respectively. A special kind of operators that are invariant under SCT, called “primaries,” deserve particular attention. By acting spatial derivatives on the primaries, their “descendants” are obtained. Each operator in CFT is a linear combination of primaries and descendants. The conformal symmetry is the maximal spacetime symmetry (except supersymmetry) that a field theory can have. It gives powerful constraints on the property of the field theory. In particular, conformal symmetry uniquely determines the form of two-point (2-pt) and three-point (3-pt) correlation functions. The 3-pt correlator of three primary operators <span>$\Phi_i,\Phi_j,\Phi_k$</span> contains a universal coefficient called the OPE coefficient <span>$f_{\Phi_i\Phi_j\Phi_k}$</span>. The collection of scaling dimensions and the OPE coefficients of primaries <span>$\{\Delta_{\Phi_i},f_{\Phi_i\Phi_j\Phi_k}\}$</span> is called the conformal data. Theoretically, with full knowledge of the CFT data, an arbitrary correlation function of a CFT can be obtained. (The full knowledge is not often possible in practice, as the number of primaries is often infinite.)</p><p>CFT has provided important insights into various aspects of theoretical physics. In condensed matter physics, it has produced useful predictions about the critical phenomena. Many classical and quantum phase transitions are conjectured to have emergent conformal symmetry in the infrared (IR), <em>i. e.</em> at long wavelength or low energy. The universal critical exponents are directly determined by the scaling dimensions of the primary operators. <em>E. g.</em>, in the 3D Ising transition that spontaneously breaks <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span> symmetry, most critical exponents are given by the scaling dimensions of the lowest <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span>-odd operator <span>$\sigma$</span> and <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span>-even operator <span>$\epsilon$</span>, such as</p><p class="math-container">\[    \eta=2\Delta_\sigma-1,\qquad\nu=\frac{1}{3-\Delta_\epsilon}.\]</p><p>CFT is also closely related to string theory and quantum gravity in high-energy physics. In the string theory, CFT describes the 2D worldsheet ; in quantum gravity, there is a conjectured duality between the gravity theory in <span>$(d+1)$</span>-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space in the bulk and a <span>$d$</span>-dimensional CFT on the boundary. Moreover, CFT plays an important role in our understanding of quantum field theories. It describes many fixed points in the RG flow, and many QFTs can be seen as CFTs with perturbations. It also helps us understand how physics changes under a change of scale and reveals some fundamental structures of the RG flow.</p><p>In 2D CFTs, besides the global conformal symmetry <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3,1)$</span>, there also exists an infinite-dimensional local conformal symmetry. Altogether, they form the Virasoro algebra. The infinite-dimensional conformal algebra has made many theories exactly solvable, especially the rational theories such as the minimal models and, more generally, the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) theories. However, going to the higher dimensions, the CFTs are much less well-studied due to a much smaller conformal group. The existing methods include numerical conformal bootstrap and Monte Carlo lattice simulations. Numerical bootstrap bounds the conformal data by making use of consistency conditions such as reflection positivity and crossing symmetry, together with some information of the CFT such as the global symmetry and a certain amount of assumptions. It has achieved great success in 3D Ising, <span>$\mathrm{O}(N)$</span> Wilson-Fisher, Gross-Neveu-Yukawa CFTs, <em>etc.</em> On the other hand, one can study a CFT by constructing a lattice model that goes through a phase transition in the corresponding universality class, and study the phase transition by Monte Carlo simulation. This method has achieved success in many phase transitions assuming conformal symmetry, <em>e. g.</em> the 3D Ising model. However, the extraction of universal data usually involves complicated and expensive finite-size scaling, and only the lowest few CFT operators can be accessed.</p><p>Among these higher dimensional CFTs, we mainly focus on <span>$d=3$</span>, as many Lagrangians in <span>$d\ge 4$</span> flow to free theories.</p><h3 id="Fuzzy-Sphere"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Fuzzy-Sphere">Fuzzy Sphere</a><a id="Fuzzy-Sphere-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Fuzzy-Sphere" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>In addition to these existing approaches, the <em>“fuzzy sphere regularisation”</em> has recently emerged as a new powerful method to study 3D CFTs. It involves studying interacting electrons moving on a sphere under the influence of a magnetic monopole at its centre.</p><p>The idea begins with putting an interacting quantum Hamiltonian on a 2-sphere <span>$S^2$</span>. This geometry preserves the full rotation symmetry (on the contrary, lattice models often only preserve a discrete subgroup). Moreover, when the system is tuned to a critical point or critical phase, combined with the time evolution direction, the system is described by a quantum field theory living on a generalised cylinder <span>$S^2\times\mathbb{R}$</span>, a manifold that is conformally equivalent to flat spacetime through the Weyl transformation</p><p class="math-container">\[    (\mathbf{r},\tau)\in S^2\times\mathbb{R}\ \longmapsto\ e^{\tau/R}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\in\mathbb{R}^3,\]</p><p>where <span>$R$</span> is the radius of the sphere and <span>$\hat{\mathbf{n}}$</span> is the unit vector corresponding to <span>$\mathbf{r}$</span>. This conformal transformation maps each time slice of the cylinder to a concentric sphere in the flat spacetime.</p><p>Thanks to the conformal flatness that is not owned by other manifolds (<em>e. g.</em>, a lattice model with periodic boundary condition lives on the torus <span>$T^2$</span>, which is not conformally flat), we can make use of some nice properties of conformal field theories. The most important one is the state-operator correspondance. Specifically, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the eigenstates of the critical Hamiltonian on the sphere and the CFT operators. One can colloquially understand the state <span>$|\Phi\rangle$</span> as the insertion of the corresponding operator <span>$\Phi(0)$</span> at the origin point into the vacuum <span>$|0\rangle$</span> : <span>$|\Phi\rangle=\hat{\Phi}(0)|0\rangle$</span>. The state and its corresponding operator have the same <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span> spin and representation under global symmetry. More importantly, as the Weyl transformation maps the Hamiltonian <span>$H$</span> that generates the time translation on the cylinder to the dilatation <span>$D$</span> on the flat spacetime, the excitation energy of a state <span>$|\Phi\rangle$</span> is proportional to the scaling dimension of the corresponding operator <span>$\Delta_\Phi$</span></p><p class="math-container">\[    E_\Phi-E_0=\frac{v}{R}\Delta_\Phi,\]</p><p>where <span>$E_0$</span> is the ground state energy, <span>$R$</span> is the radius of the sphere, and <span>$v$</span> is the speed of light that is dependent on the microscopic model and is the same for every state. With this property, one can calculate the scaling dimensions simply by solving the energy spectrum of the quantum Hamiltonian without doing complicated finite-size scalings, and one can obtain the OPE coefficients simply by taking the inner product of a local operator.</p><p>Although the quantum Hamiltonians on a sphere enjoy the full rotation symmetry and the property of state-operator correspondence, it is difficult to put a lattice on the sphere due to the curvature (in particular the non-zero Euler characteristic), especially to recover an <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span>-symmetric thermodynamic limit. An alternative way is to fuzzify the sphere. We consider charged free particles moving on a sphere with a magnetic monopole with a flux <span>$4\pi s$</span> (<span>$s\in\mathbb{Z}/2$</span>) placed at its centre. The monopole exerts a uniform magnetic field on the sphere, which modifies the single-particle Hamiltonian and the single-particle eigenstates. Now, the single particle eigenstates form highly degenerate spherical Landau levels. The lowest Landau level has a degeneracy <span>$(2s+1)$</span>. By setting the single-particle gap to be the leading energy scale, and projecting onto the lowest Landau level, we obtain a finite Hilbert space. For the purpose of numerical simulation, the system is analogous to a length-<span>$(2s+1)$</span> chain with long-range interaction, where different Landau level orbitals behave like the lattice sites. The difference is that the <span>$(2s+1)$</span> orbital forms a spin-<span>$s$</span> representation of the <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span> rotation group, and in this way, the continuous rotation symmetry is preserved. By putting multiple flavours on an orbital and adding interactions, various 3D CFTs can be realised. The interaction Hamiltonians are designed through matching the global symmetry and phase diagram. The word “fuzzy” means the non-commutativity, in our case, due to the presence of magnetic field. The non-commutativity provides a natural length scale which serves as a UV regulator of the quantum field theory. The radius of the sphere scales as <span>$R\sim\sqrt s$</span>. The thermodynamic limit can be taken as <span>$s\to\infty$</span>, and we then recover a regular sphere without non-commutativity.</p><p>The power of this approach has been first demonstrated in the context of the 3D Ising transition, where the presence of emergent conformal symmetry has been convincingly established, and a wealth of conformal data has been accurately computed. The study has then been extended to accessing various conformal data such as the OPE coefficients, correlation functions, entropic <span>$F$</span>-function, conformal generators and the cross-cap coefficients, developing techniques to improve the numerical precision, such as quantum Monte Carlo, conformal perturbation and the finite-size scaling of the ground-state energy, realising various 3D CFTs such as the free scalar, Wilson-Fisher CFTs, the <span>$\mathrm{SO}(5)$</span> and <span>$\mathrm{O}(4)$</span> deconfined criticality, <span>$\mathrm{Sp}(N)$</span>-symmetric CFTs, multi-flavour <span>$\mathrm{SU}(2)$</span> QCD, 3-state Potts model and Yang-Lee non-unitary CFT, exploring fractional quantum Hall transitions, such as the Ising CFT on the FQHE states, the confinement transition of the <span>$\nu=1/2$</span> bosonic Laughlin state, the free Marjorana fermion theory, and the transition between bosonic Pfaffian and the Halperin 220 state, studying conformal defects and boundaries such as the magnetic line defect, various conformal boundaries in the 3D Ising CFT, and lower-dimensional CFTs like 2D Ising on the fuzzy circle. In the following sections, we shall review the existing works, technical details and numerical methods. </p><h2 id="Review-of-Existing-Works"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Review-of-Existing-Works">Review of Existing Works</a><a id="Review-of-Existing-Works-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Review-of-Existing-Works" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>In this section, we review the existing works related to the fuzzy sphere.</p><h5 id="Zhu2022"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Zhu2022">The pioneering work</a><a id="Zhu2022-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Zhu2022" title="Permalink"></a></h5><blockquote><p><strong>[Zhu 2022]</strong> Uncovering conformal symmetry in the 3d Ising transition : state-operator correspondence from a quantum fuzzy sphere regularisation, Wei Zhu, Chao Han, Emilie Huffman, Johannes S. Hofmann, and Yin-Chen He, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13482">arXiv:2210.13482</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.021009">Phys. Rev. X <strong>13</strong>, 021009 (2023)</a>.</p></blockquote><p>This work first proposes the idea of the fuzzy sphere and applies it to a pedagogical example of the 3D Ising CFT. Zhu <em>et al.</em> construct a model with two flavours of fermions that resemble the spin-up and spin-down in the lattice transverse-field Ising model. At half-filling, one can colloquially think that a spin degree of freedom lives on each orbital. The Hamiltonian contains a density-density interaction (here the density operator refers to a local fermion bilinear) that resembles the Ising ferromagnetic interaction and a polarising term that resembles the transverse field. By tuning the ratio between the two terms, a transition between quantum Hall ferromagnet (a two-fold degenerate state where either of the two flavours is completely occupied) and paramagnet (a one-fold degenerate state where the superposition of the two flavours at each orbital is occupied) occurs. This transition spontaneously breaks a <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span> symmetry and falls into the Ising criticality. They then make use of a unique feature of spherical models described by CFT — state-operator correspondence — at the critical point to extract the scaling dimensions of the scaling local operators. They find evidence for the conformal symmetry, including that (1) there exists a conserved stress tensor with <span>$\Delta=3$</span> (which is used as the calibrator), and (2) all the levels can be classified into conformal multiplet where the spacings between operators&#39; scaling dimensions are very close to integer. This is one of the first numerical evidence that the 3D Ising transition has emergent conformal symmetry. More remarkably, the scaling dimensions of primaries such as <span>$\sigma,\epsilon,\epsilon&#39;$</span> are already very close to the most accurate known value by numerical bootstrap with an error within <span>$1.2\%$</span> at a small system size with the number of orbitals <span>$N_m=16$</span>, for which the computational cost is comparable to a <span>$4\times4$</span> lattice system. The structure of the Ising CFT operator spectrum already starts to show up at an even smaller system size <span>$N_m=4$</span>. All these clues point towards a curious observation that the fuzzy sphere suffers from a remarkably small finite-size effect. The detail for the construction of models is presented in the Sections <a href="#Density-Density-Interaction">“Density-Density Interaction”</a> and <a href="#Interaction-in-Terms-of-Pseudo-Potentials">“Interaction in Terms of Pseudo-Potentials”</a>, and the detail for the analysis of the spectrum is presented in Section <a href="#Operator-Spectrum-and-Search-for-Conformal-Point">“Operator Spectrum and Search for Conformal Point”</a>.</p><p>This seminal work opens a new avenue for studying 3D conformal field theories.

Typically, these methods are tested with the simplest example of the 3D Ising CFT. For many of those CFT data, the fuzzy sphere is the first non-perturbative method to access them ; for the others, the fuzzy sphere has achieved great consistency with previous methods such as quantum Monte Carlo and conformal bootstrap. So far, the accessible CFT data include operator spectrum, OPE coefficients, correlation functions, entropic <span>$F$</span>-function, conformal generators, the cross-cap coefficients. </p><h5 id="Hu2023Mar"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Hu2023Mar">OPE coefficients</a><a id="Hu2023Mar-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Hu2023Mar" title="Permalink"></a></h5><blockquote><p><strong>[Hu 2023Mar]</strong> Operator product expansion coefficients of the 3d Ising criticality via quantum fuzzy sphere, Liangdong Hu, Yin-Chen He, and Wei Zhu, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08844">arXiv:2303.08844</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.031601">Phys. Rev. Lett <strong>131</strong>, 031601 (2023)</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Apart from the operator spectrum, a wealth of CFT data can be obtained from the local operators. This work studies the local observables on the fuzzy sphere, including the density operators and certain four-fermion operators. These observables can be expressed as the linear combination of local scaling operators in the CFT. After a finite-size scaling with the data from different system sizes, the subleading contribution can be subtracted, and only the leading contribution is left. In this way, the lowest primaries in Ising CFT in each symmetry sector, <em>viz.</em> the <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span>-odd <span>$\sigma$</span> and the <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span>-even <span>$\epsilon$</span>, can be realised. The OPE coefficients are then evaluated by taking the inner product of a fuzzy sphere local observable with two CFT states <span>$\langle\Phi_1|\Phi_2(\mathbf{r})|\Phi_3\rangle$</span>. Hu <em>et al.</em> compute 17 OPE coefficients of low-lying CFT primary fields with high accuracy, including four that have not been reported before. The rest are consistent with numerical bootstrap results. It is also worth noting that this work starts to apply DMRG to the fuzzy sphere. The maximal system size is increased from <span>$N_m=18$</span> by ED to <span>$N_m=48$</span> by DMRG. The detail for calculating the OPE coefficient is presented in Section <a href="#Local-Observables">“Local Observables”</a>.</p><h5 id="Han2023Jun"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Han2023Jun">Correlation functions</a><a id="Han2023Jun-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Han2023Jun" title="Permalink"></a></h5><blockquote><p><strong>[Han 2023Jun]</strong> Conformal four-point correlators of the 3d Ising transition via the quantum fuzzy sphere, Chao Han, Liangdong Hu, Wei Zhu, and Yin-Chen He, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04681">arXiv:2306.04681</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.108.235123">Phys.

By taking the inner product of two local observables (density operators) at a time displacement <span>$\langle\Phi_1|\Phi_2(\mathbf{r}_0)\Phi_3(\mathbf{r},\tau)|\Phi_4\rangle$</span> with two CFT states, a general 4-pt function can be calculated. In practice, this piece of CFT data cannot be derived from the scaling dimensions and the OPEs due to the existence of infinitely many primaries. Han <em>et al.</em> calculate the 4-pt functions in the 3D Ising CFT with DMRG. A non-trivial check of conformality, the crossing symmetry, is verified for the correlator <span>$\langle\sigma\sigma\sigma\sigma\rangle$</span>. The special case — 2-pt functions by taking <span>$\Phi_1=\Phi_4=\mathbb{I}$</span> — is also studied and compared with the expected results by conformal symmetry.

Rev.

A remarkable quantity is called the <span>$F$</span>-function, which is defined through the scaling behaviour of the entanglement entropy. Specifically, consider a quantum system that lives on <span>$\mathbb{R}^2$</span>. A circle with radius <span>$R_d$</span> divides the system into inner part <span>$A$</span> and outer part <span>$B$</span>. The entanglement entropy is defined and expected to scale with <span>$R_d$</span> as </p><p class="math-container">\[    S_A(R_d)=-\operatorname{tr}_A\rho\log\rho=\alpha R_d/\delta-F,\]</p><p>where <span>$\delta$</span> is a UV-regulator. The constant piece is known as the <span>$F$</span>-function of a 3D CFT. The <span>$F$</span>-function is proved to be RG-monotonic, <em>i. e.</em>, along a renormalisation group flow from UV to IR, the value of <span>$F$</span>-function is non-increasing, analogous to the central charge in 2D CFTs. Despite its importance, it has never been calculated before through non-perturbative approaches in interacting 3D CFTs. This work has performed the first non-perturbative computation of <span>$F$</span> function for the 3D Ising CFT on the fuzzy sphere.

It is worthwhile to construct these IR generators by the UV operators on the fuzzy sphere. These works investigate such construction with the help of stress tensor <span>$T^{\mu\nu}$</span>. The time component <span>$T^{\tau\tau}$</span> of stress tensor equals the Hamiltonian density <span>$\mathscr{H}$</span> and it integrates into the generator <span>$\Lambda^\mu=P^\mu+K^\mu=\int\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}\,2n^\mu\mathscr{H}$</span>. The action of this generator sends a scaling operator to other operators in the same multiplet, with the number of spatial derivatives increased or decreased by one. Fardelli <em>et al.</em> and Fan calculate the matrix elements of the generators <span>$\Lambda^\mu$</span> and find good agreement with the theoretical values in the CFT, which is another non-trivial verification of conformal symmetry. Furthermore, the separate generators <span>$P^\mu$</span> and <span>$K^\mu$</span> can be obtained by considering the commutator <span>$[H,\Lambda^\mu]$</span>, which is useful in determining the primaries.

The most straightforward approach is to extract the scaling dimensions from the energy spectrum through the state-operator correspondence. Specifically, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and the CFT operators. The state and its corresponding operator has the same <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span> spin and representation under flavour symmetry, and the excitation energy of a state <span>$|\Phi\rangle$</span> is proportional to the scaling dimension of the corresponding operator <span>$\Delta_\Phi$</span></p><p class="math-container">\[    E_\Phi-E_0=\frac{v}{R}\Delta_\Phi,\]</p><p>where <span>$E_0$</span> is the ground state energy, <span>$R$</span> is the radius of the sphere (here we take <span>$R=\sqrt{N_m}$</span>), and <span>$v$</span> is a model-dependent speed of light. The constant <span>$v/R$</span> can be determined through a calibration process, <em>i. e.</em> comparing the spectrum to some known properties of a CFT spectrum. The criteria to determine the conformal symmetry include</p><ol><li>The existence of a conserved stress tensor <span>$T^{\mu\nu}$</span>. The stress tensor is the symmetry current of the translation transformation. It is known to be a singlet under the flavour symmetry, have spin-2 under <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span> rotation and scaling dimension exactly <span>$\Delta_{T^{\mu\nu}}=3$</span>.</li><li>The existence of a conserved flavour symmetry current <span>$J^\mu$</span> if there is a continuous flavour symmetry. The symmetry current typically lives in the antisymmetric rank-2 tensor representation of the flavour symmetry. <em>E. g.</em>, if the flavour symmetry is <span>$\mathrm{U}(1)$</span>, then the symmetry current has charge-0 ; if the flavour symmetry is <span>$\mathrm{O}(3)$</span>, then the symmetry current has spin-1 and is odd under the improper <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span> transformation ; if the flavour symmetry is <span>$\mathrm{O}(n)$</span> (<span>$n\ge 4$</span>) or <span>$\mathrm{SU}(n)$</span> (<span>$n\ge 3$</span>), then the symmetry current lives in the antisymmetric rank-<span>$2$</span> tensor representation.</li><li>The organisation of the operator spectrum into conformal multiplets. All the levels in the spectrum of a CFT can be organised into the conformal primaries and their descendants. The descendants live in the same representation under the flavour symmetry as the primary, and the difference between the scaling dimensions of a primary and its descendant is an integer.

Among these, ED and DMRG have been implemented in FuzzifiED.</p><h3 id="Exact-Diagonalisation-(ED)"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Exact-Diagonalisation-(ED)">Exact Diagonalisation (ED)</a><a id="Exact-Diagonalisation-(ED)-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Exact-Diagonalisation-(ED)" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Exact diagonalisation (ED) might be the most straightforward method for solving a quantum many-body Hamiltonian. In ED, one constructs a many-body basis and writes down all the non-zero elements of the Hamiltonian as a sparse matrix on this basis. The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with the lowest energy can be solved without finding the full eigensystem by Arnoldi or Lanczos algorithm.</p><p>Briefly speaking, the Arnoldi algorithm is an iterative method. Each iteration constructs an orthonormal basis of the Krylov subspace from an initial vector and finds an approximation to the eigenvector on that basis. This approximate eigenvector is then used as the initial vector for the next iteration. An example of Krylov subspace is spanned by acting the matrix <span>$H$</span> repeatedly on the initial vector <span>$|i\rangle$</span></p><p class="math-container">\[    \mathscr{K}_r(H,|i\rangle)=\operatorname{span}\left\{|i\rangle,H|i\rangle,H^2|i\rangle,\dots,H^{r-1}|i\rangle\right\}.\]</p><p>The ED calculation can be optimised in several ways. The storage of the Hamiltonian matrix may be compressed by data structure tailored for sparse matrix such as compressed sparse column (CSC). The Hamiltonian matrix is usually block diagonal due to the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The Hilbert space is divided into several sectors that carry different representations under the symmetry, and acting the Hamiltonian on a state in a sector results in a state in the same sector. <em>E. g.</em>, in the ED calculation for the Ising model on the fuzzy sphere, the symmetries we can use include two <span>$\mathrm{U}(1)$</span> symmetries, <em>viz.</em> the conservation of particle number and the angular momentum in the <span>$z$</span>-direction, and three <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span> symmetries, <em>viz.</em> the Ising <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span> flavour symmetry, the particle-hole symmetry and the <span>$\pi$</span>-rotation along the <span>$y$</span>-axis.</p><p>The ED method enjoys several advantages, including (1) the full knowledge of the eigenstate wave-function and (2) the ability to access relatively high excited states. However, despite these optimisations, the dimension of the Hilbert space scales exponentially with the number of orbitals. This results in exponentially growing space and time complexity. <em>E. g.</em>, for the Ising model on the fuzzy sphere, for <span>$N_m=14$</span>, the dimension of Hilbert space <span>$\dim\mathscr{H}=1.8\times10^5$</span> and the number of elements in the Hamiltonian is <span>$N_ \text{el}=1.1\times 10^7$</span> ; for <span>$N_m=16$</span>, the numbers have already grown to <span>$\dim\mathscr{H}=2.2\times10^6$</span> and <span>$N_\text{el}=2.1\times 10^8$</span>, which translates to a memory demand of <span>$3.1$</span> gigabytes.</p><p>In FuzzifiED, we use the Fortran library Arpack to perform the Arnoldi algorithm.</p><h3 id="Density-Matrix-Renormalisation-Group-(DMRG)"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Density-Matrix-Renormalisation-Group-(DMRG)">Density Matrix Renormalisation Group (DMRG)</a><a id="Density-Matrix-Renormalisation-Group-(DMRG)-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Density-Matrix-Renormalisation-Group-(DMRG)" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>To overcome the size limit of ED, the density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) is a powerful method to calculate the ground state of a quasi-one-dimensional system. It was first invented by White as an improvement to the numerical renormalisation group (NRG) used in the Kondo problem. Since its proposal, it has been proven potent in various problems in condensed matter physics, such as the static and dynamic properties of one-dimensional models such as the Heisenberg, <span>$t$</span>–<span>$J$</span> and Hubbard models. Later, Schollw\&quot;ock has discovered a new point of view that implements the DMRG in the language of matrix product states (MPS).</p><p>Briefly speaking, in this language, DMRG is a variational method that optimises the fidelity between the exact ground state and the variational MPS. During each “sweep,” DMRG solves a local eigenvalue problem for the active tensors to improve the approximation. To find the excited states, one needs to add projection <span>$|0\rangle\langle 0|$</span> of the ground state <span>$|0\rangle$</span> to the Hamiltonian by hand.</p><p>Although the fuzzy sphere deals with <span>$(2+1)$</span>-dimensional quantum systems, the basis of the lowest Landau level provides a natural way to express it as a quasi-1D problem. Therefore, DMRG has been a powerful numerical method for the fuzzy sphere. However, like other <span>$(2+1)$</span>D models, the DMRG on the fuzzy sphere also suffers from the divergence of the required maximal bond dimension with system size. One should thus be careful with the convergence of the results when doing DMRG.</p><p>In FuzzifiED, we use the ITensor library in Julia to perform the DMRG calculations.</p></article><nav class="docs-footer"><a class="docs-footer-prevpage" href="../">« Home</a><a class="docs-footer-nextpage" href="../tutorial/">Tutorial »</a><div class="flexbox-break"></div><p class="footer-message">Powered by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Programming Language</a>.
