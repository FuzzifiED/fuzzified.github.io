href="#Conformal-field-theory" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Conformal field theory (CFT) is one of the central topics of modern physics. It refers to a field theory that is invariant under conformal transformations that preserve the angles between vectors. In spacetime dimension <span>$d&gt;2$</span>, the global conformal symmetry is generated by translation, <span>$\mathrm{SO}(d)$</span> rotation (In this note we work in Euclidean signature. In Lorentzian signature it is the Lorentz transformation <span>$\mathrm{SO}(1,d-1)$</span>), dilatation (scale transformation), and special conformal transformation (SCT). These transformations altogether generate the conformal group <span>$\mathrm{SO}(d+1,1)$</span>. Each CFT operator must transform under irreducible representations of rotation and dilatation. The representations are labelled by <span>$\mathrm{SO}(d)$</span> spin <span>$l$</span> and scaling dimension <span>$\Delta$</span>, respectively. A special kind of operators that are invariant under SCT called « primaries » deserve particular attension. By acting the space derivatives on the primaries, their « descendants » are obtained. The conformal symmetry is the maximal spacetime symmetry that a field theory can have. It gives powerful constraint on the property of the field theory. In particular, conformal symmetry uniquely determines the form of two-point and three-point correlation functions. The three-point correlator of three primary operators <span>$\Phi_i,\Phi_j,\Phi_k$</span> contains a universal coefficient called the OPE coefficient <span>$f_{\Phi_i\Phi_j\Phi_k}$</span>. The collection of scaling dimensions and the OPE coefficients <span>$\{\Delta_{\Phi_i},f_{\Phi_i\Phi_j\Phi_k}\}$</span> is called the conformal data. Theoretically, with full knowledge of the CFT data, an arbitrary correlation function of a CFT can be obtained. </p><p>CFT has provided important insights into various fields of theoretical physics. In condensed matter physics, it has produced useful prediction about the critical phenomena. Many classical and quantum phase transitions are conjectured to have emergent conformal symmetry in the IR. The universal critical exponents are directly determined by the scaling dimensions of the primary operators. <em>E.g.</em>, in Ising transitions that spontaneously break <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span> symmetry, most critical exponents are given by the scaling dimensions of the lowest <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span>-odd operator <span>$\sigma$</span> and <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span>-even operator <span>$\epsilon$</span>, such as</p><p class="math-container">\[\eta=2\Delta_\sigma-1\qquad\nu=\frac{1}{3-\Delta_\epsilon}\]</p><p>CFT is also closely related to string theory and quantum gravity in high energy physics. In the string theory, CFT  describes the 2d worldsheet ; in quantum gravity, there is a conjectured duality between the gravity theory in <span>$(d+1)$</span>-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space in the bulk and a <span>$d$</span>-dimensional CFT on the boundary. Moreover, CFT plays an important role in our understanding of quantum field theories. It describes many fixed points in the RG flow and many QFTs can be seen as a CFT with perturbations. It also helps us understand how physics change under a change of scale and reveals some fundamental structure of the RG flow. </p><p>In 2d CFTs, besides the global conformal symmetry <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3,1)$</span>, there also exists an infinite dimensional local conformal symmetry. Altogether, they form the Virasoro algebra. The infinite dimensional conformal algebra has made many theories exactly solvable, especially the rational theories such as the minimal models and more generally the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) theories. On the other hand, going to the higher dimensions, the CFTs are much less well-studied due to a much smaller conformal group. The existing methods include numerical conformal bootstrap and Monte Carlo lattice simulations. Numerical boostrap bounds the conformal data by making use of consistency conditions such as reflection positivity together with some information of the CFT such as the global symmetry and a certain amount of assumptions. It has achieved great success in 3d Ising, <span>$\mathrm{O}(N)$</span> Wilson-Fisher, Gross-Neveu CFTs, <em>etc.</em> On the other hand, one can study a CFT by constructing a lattice model that goes through a phase transition in the corresponding universality class, and study the phase transition by Monte Carlo simulation. The extraction of universal data usually involves complicated and expensive finite-size scaling, and only the lowest few CFT operators can be accessed in this way. </p><p>Among these higher dimensional CFTs, we especially focus on <span>$d=3$</span>, as many Lagrangians in <span>$d\ge 4$</span> flow to free theories. </p><h3 id="Fuzzy-sphere"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Fuzzy-sphere">Fuzzy sphere</a><a id="Fuzzy-sphere-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Fuzzy-sphere" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>In addition to these existing approaches, the <em>« fuzzy sphere regularisation »</em> has recently emerged as a new powerful method to study 3d CFTs. The idea is to put an interacting quantum Hamiltonian on a 2-sphere <span>$S^2$</span>. This geometry preserves the full rotation symmetry (on the contrary, lattice models often only preserve a discrete subgroup). Moreover, when the system is tuned to a critical point or critical phase, combined with the time evolution direction, the system is described by a quantum field theory living on a generalised cylinder <span>$S^2\times\mathbb{R}$</span>, a manifold that is conformally equivalent to flat spacetime through the Weyl transformation</p><p class="math-container">\[    (\hat{\mathbf{n}},\tau)\in S^2\times\mathbb{R}\ \longmapsto\ r\hat{\mathbf{n}}\in\mathbb{R}^3,\qquad r=e^{\tau/R}\]</p><p>where <span>$R$</span> is the radius of the sphere. This conformal transformation maps each time slice of the cylinder to a cocentric sphere in the the flat spacetime. </p><p>Thanks to the conformal flatness that is not owned by other manifolds (<em>e.g.</em>, a lattice model with periodic boundary condition lives on the torus <span>$T^2$</span> which is not conformally flat), we can make use of some nice properties of conformal field theories, the most important one of which is the state-operator correspondance. Specifically, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the eigenstates of the critical Hamiltonian on the sphere and the CFT operators.  One can colloquially understand the state <span>$|\Phi\rangle$</span> as the insertion of the corresponding operator <span>$\Phi(0)$</span> at the origin point into the vacuum <span>$|0\rangle$</span> : <span>$|\Phi\rangle=\Phi(0)|0\rangle$</span>. The state and its corresponding operator has the same <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span> spin and representation under global symmetry. More importantly, as the Weyl transformation maps the Hamiltonian <span>$H$</span> corresponding to the time translation on the cylinder to the dilatation <span>$D$</span> on the flat spacetime, the excitation energy of a state <span>$|\Phi\rangle$</span> is proportional to the scaling dimension of the corresponding operator <span>$\Delta_\Phi$</span></p><p class="math-container">\[    E_\Phi-E_0=\frac{v}{R}\Delta_\Phi\]</p><p>where <span>$E_0$</span> is the ground state energy, <span>$R$</span> is the radius of the sphere, and <span>$v$</span> is the speed of light that is dependent on the microscopic model and is the same for different states. With this property, one can calculate the scaling dimensions simply by obtaining the energy spectrum of the quantum Hamiltonian without doing complicated finite size scalings, and one can obtain the OPE coefficients simply from the inner product of a local operator.</p><p>Although the quantum Hamiltonians on a sphere enjoy the full rotation symmetry and the property of state-operator correspondence, it is difficult to put a lattice on the sphere due to the curvature (in particular the non-zero Euler characteristic), especially to recover an <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span>-symmetric theomodynamic limit. An alternative way we take is to fuzzify the sphere. We consider charged free particles moving on a sphere with a magnetic monopole with a flux <span>$4\pi s$</span> (<span>$s\in\mathbb{Z}/2$</span>) placed at its centre. The monopole exerts a uniform magnetic field on the sphere, which modifies the single particle Hamiltonian and the single particle eigenstates. Now the single particle eigenstates form highly degenerate spherical Landau levels. The lowest Landau level has a degeneracy <span>$(2s+1)$</span>. By setting the single particle gap to be the leading energy scale, adding interactions, and projecting onto the lowest Landau level, we obtain a finite Hilbert space. For the sake of numerical simulation, the system is analoguous to a length-<span>$(2s+1)$</span> spin chain with long range interaction, where different Landau level orbitals behave like the lattice sites. The difference is that the <span>$(2s+1)$</span> orbital forms a spin-<span>$s$</span> representation of the <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span> rotation group, and in this way the continuous rotation symmetry is preserved. The word « fuzzy » means the non-commutativity, in our case, due to the presence of magnetic field. The non-commutativity provides a natural length scale which serves as a UV regulator of the quantum field theory. The radius of the sphere scales as <span>$R\sim\sqrt s$</span>. The thermodynic limit can be taken as <span>$s\to\infty$</span>, and we then recover a regular sphere without non-commutativity. </p><p>The power of this approach has been first demonstrated in the context of the 3D Ising transition, where the presence of emergent conformal symmetry has been convincingly established and a wealth of conformal data has been accurately computed. The study has then been extended to accessing various conformal data such as the OPE coefficients, correlation functions, entropic <span>$F$</span>-function, conformal generators in the 3d Ising CFT, studying conformal defects and boundaries such as the magnetic line defect, various conformal boundaries in 3D Ising CFT, and realising various 3d CFTs such as Wilson-Fisher CFTs, <span>$\mathrm{SO}(5)$</span> deconfined criticality, <span>$\mathrm{Sp}(N)$</span> symmetric CFTs, <em>etc.</em> In the following sections, we shall review the existing works, technical details and the numerical methods. </p><h2 id="Review-of-existing-work"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Review-of-existing-work">Review of existing work</a><a id="Review-of-existing-work-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Review-of-existing-work" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>In this section, we review the existing work related to fuzzy sphere. </p><h5 id="Zhu2022"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Zhu2022">The pioneering work</a><a id="Zhu2022-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Zhu2022" title="Permalink"></a></h5><blockquote><p><strong>[Zhu 2022]</strong> Uncovering conformal symmetry in the 3d Ising transition : state-operator correspondence from a quantum fuzzy sphere regularisation, Wei Zhu, Chao Han, Emilie Huffman, Johannes S.

X <strong>13</strong>, 021009 (2023)</a>.</p></blockquote><p>This work first proposes the idea of fuzzy sphere and apply it to a pedagogical example of 3d Ising CFT. This work constructs a model with two flavours of fermions that resembles the spin-up and spin-down in the lattice transverse-field Ising model. At half-filling, one can colloquially think that a spin degree of freedom lives on each orbital. The Hamiltonian contains a density-density interaction that resembles the Ising ferromagnetic interaction and a polarising terms that resembles the transverse field. By tuning the ratio of the two terms, a transition between quantum Hall ferromagnet (a two-fold degenerate state where either of the two flavours is completely occupied) and paramagnet (a one-fold degenerate state where the superpositions of the two flavours at each orbital are occupied) occurs. This transition spontaneously breaks a <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span> symmetry and falls into the Ising criticality. This work then make use of a unique feature of spherical models described by CFT – state-operator correspondence – at the critical point to extract the scaling dimensions of the scaling local operators. This work finds evidence for conformal symmetry, including that (1) there exists a conserved stress tensor with <span>$\Delta=3$</span> (which is used as the calibrator), and (2) all the levels can be classified into conformal multiplet where the spacing between operators&#39; scaling dimensions are very close to integer. This is one of the first numerical evidence that 3d Ising transition has emergent conformal symmetry. More remarkably, the scaling dimensions of primaries such as <span>$\sigma,\epsilon,\epsilon&#39;$</span> are already very close to the most accurate known value by numerical bootstrap with an error within <span>$1.2\%$</span> at a small system size <span>$N_m=16$</span>, for which the computational cost is comparable to a <span>$4\times4$</span> lattice system. The structure of Ising CFT operator spectrum already starts to show up at an even smaller system size <span>$N_m=4$</span>. All these clues point towards a curious observation that fuzzy sphere suffers from a remarkably small finite-size effect. </p><p>This seminal work opens a new avenue for studying 3d conformal field theories. After that, most of the researches on fuzzy sphere can roughly be catagorised into three directions (with several exceptions) :</p><ol><li><p>Accessing various conformal data, </p></li><li><p>Realising various 3d CFTs, and</p></li><li><p>Studying conformal defects and boundaries.</p></li></ol><h3 id="Accessing-various-conformal-data"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Accessing-various-conformal-data">Accessing various conformal data</a><a id="Accessing-various-conformal-data-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Accessing-various-conformal-data" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>The first direction is to develop methods to calculate various data and quantities of 3d CFTs on fuzzy sphere. Typically, these methods are tested on the simplest example of 3d Ising CFT. For many of those CFT data, fuzzy sphere is the first non-perturbative method to access them ; for the others, the fuzzy sphere has achieved great consistency with previous methods such as quantum Monte Carlo and conformal bootstrap. So far, the accessible CFT data include operator spectrum, OPE coefficients, correlation functions, entropic <span>$F$</span>-function and conformal generators. </p><h5 id="Hu2023Mar"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Hu2023Mar">OPE coefficients</a><a id="Hu2023Mar-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Hu2023Mar" title="Permalink"></a></h5><blockquote><p><strong>[Hu 2023Mar]</strong> Operator product expansion coefficients of the 3d Ising criticality via quantum fuzzy sphere, Liangdong Hu, Yin-Chen He, and Wei Zhu, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08844">arXiv:2303.08844</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.031601">Phys.

This work studies the local observables on the fuzzy sphere, including the density operators and certain four-fermion operators. These observables can be expressed as the linear combination of CFT local scaling operators. After a finite size scaling that takes into account the data from different system sizes, the subleading contribution can be substracted and only the leading contribution are left. In this way, the lowest primaries in Ising CFT in each symmetry sector, <em>viz.</em> <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span>-odd <span>$\sigma$</span> and <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span>-even <span>$\epsilon$</span>, can be realised. The OPE coefficients are then evaluated by taking the inner product of a fuzzy sphere local observable with two CFT states <span>$\langle\Phi_1|\Phi_2(\hat{\mathbf{n}})|\Phi_3\rangle$</span>. This work computes 17 OPE coefficients of low-lying CFT primary fields with high accuracy, including 4 that has not being reported before. The rest are consistent with numerical bootstrap results. It is also worth noting that this work start to apply DMRG to the fuzzy sphere. The maximal system size is increased from <span>$N_m=18$</span> by ED to <span>$N_m=48$</span> by DMRG.</p><h5 id="Han2023Jun"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Han2023Jun">Correlation functions</a><a id="Han2023Jun-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Han2023Jun" title="Permalink"></a></h5><blockquote><p><strong>[Han 2023Jun]</strong> Conformal four-point correlators of the 3d Ising transition via the quantum fuzzy sphere, Chao Han, Liangdong Hu, Wei Zhu, and Yin-Chen He, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04681">arXiv:2306.04681</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.108.235123">Phys.

This piece of CFT data in practice cannot be derived from the rest. This work calculates this four-point function in 3d Ising CFT with DMRG. A non-trivial check of conformality, the crossing symmetry, is verified for the correlator <span>$\langle\sigma\sigma\sigma\sigma\rangle$</span>.

A remarkable quantity is called the <span>$F$</span>-function, which is defined through the scaling behaviour of the entanglement entropy. Specifically, consider a quantum system that lives on <span>$\mathbb{R}^2$</span>. A circle with radius <span>$R_d$</span> divides the system into inner part <span>$A$</span> and outer part <span>$B$</span>. The entanglement entropy is defined and expected to scale with <span>$R_d$</span> as </p><p class="math-container">\[    S_A(R_d)=\operatorname{tr}_A\rho\log\rho=\alpha R_d/\delta-F\]</p><p>where <span>$\delta$</span> is a UV-regulator. The constant part is known as the <span>$F$</span>-function of a 3d CFT. The <span>$F$</span>-function is proved to be RG-monotonic, <em>i.e.</em>, along a renormalisation group flow from UV to IR, the value of <span>$F$</span>-function is non-increasing, analogous to the central charge in 2d CFTs. Despite its importance, it has never been calculated before through non-perturbative approaches in interacting 3d CFTs. This work has performed the first non-perturbative computation of <span>$F$</span> function for paradigmatic 3d Ising CFT on fuzzy sphere. The sphere is cut in the real space into two crowns along a latitude circle <span>$\theta$</span>, and the entanglement entropy <span>$S_A(\theta)$</span> as a function of <span>$\theta$</span> is calculated. The <span>$F$</span>-function is extracted from the <span>$S_A(\theta)$</span> in vicinity of the equator, and the result yields <span>$F_A=0.0612(5)$</span> after a finite size scaling.</p><h5 id="Fardelli2024"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Fardelli2024">Conformal generators</a><a id="Fardelli2024-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Fardelli2024" title="Permalink"></a></h5><blockquote><p><strong>[Fardelli 2024]</strong> Constructing the infrared conformal generators on the fuzzy sphere, Giulia Fardelli, A.

Deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) is one of the pioneering example of phase transitions beyond Landau paradigm. It has led to numerous theoretical surprises including the emergent <span>$\mathrm{SO}(5)$</span> symmetry and the duality between interacting theories. Despite extensive studies over the past two decades, its nature remains controversial. The two competing scenarios are (1) DQCP is truely critical, and (2) DQCP is pseudocritical, <em>i.e.</em>, a weakly first-order phase transition that has approximate critical behaviour, and is controlled by a pair of complex fixed points very close to the pseudocritical region.</p><p>The DQCP can be conveniently studied on the fuzzy sphere by constructing a non-linear sigma model (NLσM) on target space <span>$S^4$</span> with a level-1 topological Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term, which serves as a dual description of the DQCP with an exact <span>$\mathrm{SO}(5)$</span> symmetry. The idea is to construct a four-flavour model with global symmetry <span>$\mathrm{Sp}(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2=\mathrm{SO}(5)$</span> (<span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span> means to gauge the pseudoreal representations). At half-filling, it can be described by a NLσM on the Grassmannian <span>$\tfrac{\mathrm{Sp}(2)}{\mathrm{Sp}(1)\times\mathrm{Sp}(1)}\cong S^4$</span> and the WZW level can be matched. This work provides evidence that the DQCP exhibits approximate conformal symmetry. This work has identified 19 conformal primaries and their 82 descendants. Furthermore, by examining the renormalisation group flow of the lowest symmetry singlet, this work demonstrates that the DQCP is more likely pseudo-critical, with the approximate conformal symmetry plausibly emerging from nearby complex fixed points.</p><h5 id="Han2023Dec"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Han2023Dec">The <span>$\mathrm{O}(3)$</span> Wilson-Fisher</a><a id="Han2023Dec-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Han2023Dec" title="Permalink"></a></h5><blockquote><p><strong>[Han 2023Dec]</strong> Conformal operator content of the Wilson-Fisher transition on fuzzy sphere bilayers, Chao Han, Liangdong Hu, and Wei Zhu, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04047">arXiv:2312.04047</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.115113">Phys.

The most straightforward approach is to extract the scaling dimensions from the energy spectrum through the state-operator correspondence. Specifically, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and the CFT operators. The state and its corresponding operator has the same <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span> spin and representation under flavour symmetry, and the excitation energy of a state <span>$|\Phi\rangle$</span> is proportional to the scaling dimension of the corresponding operator <span>$\Delta_\Phi$</span></p><p class="math-container">\[    E_\Phi-E_0=\frac{v}{R}\Delta_\Phi\]</p><p>where <span>$E_0$</span> is the ground state energy, <span>$R$</span> is the radius of the sphere (here we take <span>$R=\sqrt{N_m}$</span>), and <span>$v$</span> is the model-dependent speed of light. The constant <span>$v/R$</span> can be determined through a calibration process, <em>i.e.</em>, comparing the spectrum to some known properties of a CFT spectrum. The criteria to determine the conformal symmetry include </p><ol><li><p>The existence of a conserved stress tensor <span>$T^{\mu\nu}$</span>. The stress tensor is the symmetry current of the translation transformation. It is known to be a singlet under the flavour symmetry, have spin-2 under <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span> rotation and scaling dimension exactly <span>$\Delta_{T^{\mu\nu}}=3$</span>.</p></li><li><p>The existence of a conserved flavour symmetry current <span>$J^\mu$</span> if there is a continuous flavour symmetry. The symmetry current typically lives in the antisymmetric rank-2 tensor representation of the flavour symmetry. <em>E.g.</em>, if the flavour symmetry is <span>$\mathrm{U}(1)$</span>, then the symmetry current has charge-0 ; if the flavour symmetry is <span>$\mathrm{O}(3)$</span>, then the symmetry current has spin-1 and is odd under the improper <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span> transformation ; if the flavour symmetry is <span>$\mathrm{O}(n)$</span> (<span>$n\ge 4$</span>) or <span>$\mathrm{SU}(n)$</span> (<span>$n\ge 3$</span>), then the symmetry current lives in the antisymmetric rank-<span>$2$</span> tensor representation. </p></li><li><p>The organisation of the operator spectrum into conformal multiplets. All the levels in the spectrum of a CFT can be organised into the conformal primaries and their descendants. The descendants live in the same representation under the flavour symmetry as the primary, and the difference between the scaling dimensions of a primary and its descendant is an integer. Specifically, for a scalar primary <span>$\Phi$</span>, its descendants have the form <span>$\Box^n\partial^{\mu_1}\partial^{\mu_2}\dots\partial^{\mu_l}\Phi-\textrm{(trace)}$</span> (<span>$n,l=0,1,2,\dots$</span>) with <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span> spin-<span>$l$</span> and scaling dimension <span>$\Phi+2n+l$</span>, where <span>$\Box=\partial_\mu\partial^\nu$</span>. For a spinning primary <span>$\Phi^{\mu_1\dots\mu_s}$</span>, its descendants has the two forms : <span>$\Box^n\partial^{\nu_1}\dots\partial^{\nu_m}\partial_{\rho_1}\dots\partial_{\rho_k}\Phi^{\rho_1\dots\rho_{k}\mu_1\dots \mu_{s-k}}$</span> (<span>$k=0,\dots,s$</span>, <span>$n,m=0,1,\dots$</span>) with scaling dimension <span>$\Delta_\Phi+k+m+2n$</span> and <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span> spin-<span>$(s-k+m)$</span>, and <span>$\Box^n\partial^{\nu_1}\dots\partial^{\nu_m}\partial_{\rho_1}\dots\partial_{\rho_k}\epsilon^{\sigma}{}_{\tilde{\mu}\tilde{\nu}}\partial^{\tilde{\nu}}\Phi^{\rho_1\dots\rho_{k}\tilde{\mu}\mu_1\dots \mu_{s-k-1}}$</span> (<span>$k=0,\dots,s-1$</span>, <span>$n,m=0,1,\dots$</span>) with scaling dimension <span>$\Delta_\Phi+k+m+2n+1$</span> and <span>$\mathrm{SO}(3)$</span> spin-<span>$(s-k+m)$</span>.

The numerical methods that have been applied to fuzzy sphere include exact diagonalisation (ED), density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) and determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC). Among these ED and DMRG have been implemented in FuzzifiED. </p><h3 id="Exact-diagonalisation-(ED)"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Exact-diagonalisation-(ED)">Exact diagonalisation (ED)</a><a id="Exact-diagonalisation-(ED)-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Exact-diagonalisation-(ED)" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Exact diagonalisation (ED) might be the most straightforward method to solve a quantum many-body Hamiltonian. In ED, one construct a many-body basis and write down all the elements of the Hamiltonian matrix on these basis. The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with the lowest energy can be solved without finding the full eigensystem by Arnoldi or Lanczos algorithm. </p><p>Briefly speaking, the Arnoldi algorithm is an iterative method. In each iteration, it constructs an orthonormal basis of the Krylov subspace from an initial vector and finds an approximation to the eigenvector in that basis. This approximate eigenvector is then used as the initial vector for the next iteration. An example of Krylov subspace is spanned by acting the matrix <span>$H$</span> repeatedly on the initial vector <span>$|i\rangle$</span></p><p class="math-container">\[    \mathcal{K}_r(H,|i\rangle)=\operatorname{span}\left\{|i\rangle,H|i\rangle,H^2|i\rangle,\dots,H^{n-1}|i\rangle\right\}\]</p><p>The ED calculation can be optimised in several ways. The storage of the Hamiltonian matrix may be compressed by data structure taylored for sparse matrix such as compressed sârse column (CSC). The Hamiltonian matrix is usually block diagonal due to symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The Hilbert space is divided into several sectors that carry different representation under the symmetry, and acting the Hamiltonian on a state in a sector results in a state in the same sector. \textit{E.g.}, in the ED calculation for the Ising model on the fuzzy sphere, the symmetries we can use include two <span>$\mathrm{U}(1)$</span> symmetries, \textit{viz.} the conservation of particle number and the angular momentum in the <span>$z$</span>-direction, and three <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span> symmetries, \textit{viz.} the Ising <span>$\mathbb{Z}_2$</span> flavour symmetry, the particle-hole symmetry and the <span>$\pi$</span>-rotation along the <span>$y$</span>-axis\footnote{So far, FuzzifiED only supports <span>$\mathrm{U}(1)$</span> and <span>$\mathbb{Z}_p$</span> symmetries. We are still trying to implement non-abelian symmetries.}.</p><p>The ED method enjoy several advantages, including (1) the full knowledge of the eigenstate wavefunction and (2) the ability to access relatively high excited states. However, despite these optimisations, the dimension of the Hilbert space scales exponentially with the number of orbitals. This results in exponentially growing space and time complexity. \textit{E.g.}, for the Ising model on the fuzzy sphere, for <span>$N_m=12$</span>, the dimension of Hilbert space <span>$\dim\mathcal{H}=1.6\times10^4$</span> and the number of elements in the Hamiltonian is <span>$N_ \mathrm{el}=6.5\times 10^5$</span>~; for <span>$N_m=14$</span>, the number have already grown to <span>$\dim\mathcal{H}=1.8\times10^5$</span> and <span>$N_\textrm{el}=1.1\times 10^7$</span>, which translates to a memory demand of <span>$0.2$</span> gigabytes. </p><p>In FuzzifiED, we use the celebrated Fortran library Arpack to perform the Arnoldi algorithm. </p><h3 id="Density-matrix-renormalisation-group-(DMRG)"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Density-matrix-renormalisation-group-(DMRG)">Density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG)</a><a id="Density-matrix-renormalisation-group-(DMRG)-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Density-matrix-renormalisation-group-(DMRG)" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>To overcome the size limit of ED, density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) is a powerful method calculating the ground state of a quasi-one-dimensional system. It has been first first invented by S. R. White as an improvement to the numerical renormalisation group (NRG) used in the Kondo problem. Since its proposal, it has been proven powerful in various problems in condensed matter physics, such as the static and dynamic properties of one-dimensional models such as the Heisenberg, <span>$t$</span>–-<span>$J$</span> and Hubbard models. Later, Schollw\&quot;ock has discovered a new point of view that implements the DMRG in the language of matrix product states (MPS). </p><p>Briefly speaking, in this language, DMRG is a variational method that optimises the fidelity between the exact ground state and the variational MPS. To find the lowest excited state, one need to add projection <span>$|0\rangle\langle 0|$</span> of the ground state <span>$|0\rangle$</span> to the Hamiltonian by hand. Due to the complexity of this process, the higher excited state are difficult to access.</p><p>Although the fuzzy sphere deals with <span>$(2+1)$</span>-dimensional quantum systems, the basis of lowest Landau level provides a natural way to express it as a quasi-1d problem. Therefore, DMRG has been a powerful numerical method for fuzzy sphere. However, like other <span>$(2+1)$</span>d models, the DMRG on fuzzy sphere also suffers from the divergence of the required maximal bond dimension with system size. One should thus be careful with checking the convergence of the results when doing DMRG. </p><p>In FuzzifiED, we use the ITensor Package in Julia to perform the DMRG calculations. </p></article><nav class="docs-footer"><a class="docs-footer-prevpage" href="../">« Home</a><a class="docs-footer-nextpage" href="../example/">Examples »</a><div class="flexbox-break"></div><p class="footer-message">Powered by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Programming Language</a>.
